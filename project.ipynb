If there are figures of its architecture, use, or products (e.g., from the docs), you're welcome to include them here. This is an example diagram included in the notebook:\n",

    "The purpose of this software package is to do matrix manipulation through riemannian geometry. Riemannian geometry is a branch of geometry that has inner product on tangent space. In a short summary, Riemannian geometry is used in calculus and Linear ALgebra. It helps to study smooth manifolds. The code is written in python and the purpose is to use matrices to help graph these out. The author for this is Alexandre Barachant, a research scientist with specialty in Machine Learning and Neuroscience. His goal with this project(which is still in development stages) is to use this kind of software to help map biosginals like EEG, MEG, and or EMG. These kind og signals are found in the brain and the kind of shape to map out for the brian is part of riemannian geometry. This programs purpose is to help in the neuroscience field and help detect problems in the brain related to the biosignals. \n",

    "## Method as it appears in the software\n",
    "\n",
    "What role does the method play in the software? How does one call it (perhaps via a higher level interface that uses the method)? Are there particular performance concerns that went into its use? How expensive is it? Can you express performance in terms that are relevant to a user? How about accuracy, conditioning, or stability in the chosen formulation?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        I selected this program because the use of matrices are similar in the mapping. We did basic matrices mapping in python, but this took this more in depth and advance software that is relevant to the stuff we are doing.\n",
    "        The program here is Tangent space projecting. With each projection, each matrix is represented by N(N+1)/2 where is N stands for the dimension. Tangent space projection is helpful because convert covariance matrices to euclidean vectors.\n",

I tried my best to get the jist of it to help the reader. I felt anything outside of this would put the reader more confused and not help learn about this topic. I tried to answer all of the questions to the best of my ability but it was very hard to get all the information possible since it was a very big program. \n",
